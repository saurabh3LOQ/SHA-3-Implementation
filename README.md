This is an unfinished and untested implementation of the SHA-3 Winner: Keccak.

It is therefore STRONGLY reccommended you do not use this at all in any security related application!

More information about the Keccak hash can be found on their website: http://keccak.noekeon.org/
Progress updates will be posted on this code here: https://plus.google.com/116160455993590189762
